GamesHouse is a server application meant to make easy to create persistent multiplayer browser games.

It gives the next features:

- Easy to add new games: there is JSON that contains all the info about all available games and its dependencies.
- Always on: games can be running on the server even when no players are connected if the game wants.
- Awake/Sleep: Host or games themselves can put to sleep an instance if no players are connected, and awake it when a new player joins.
- Persistence: Games can save its state and restore it.
- Multiple-instances: You can have several instances of the same game
- Invitation system: Players can invite other players to their games (using URLs or QR codes)
- Dashboard: The Game master can monitorize his games thanks to a dashboard where they can read logs, kick players or manage game internals.
